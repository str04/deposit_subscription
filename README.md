## Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis and Prediction

#### Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of bank customers and their responses to various marketing campaigns. The goal is to understand the factors influencing a customer's decision to subscribe to a term deposit and assess the effectiveness of the bank's marketing strategies. Through data analysis, machine learning models have been developed to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and financial characteristics.

Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following features:
- Age: Customer's age.
- Job: Customer's occupation.
- Marital Status: Customer's marital status (single, married, divorced).
- Education Level: Customer's educational qualifications.
- Balance: The balance in the customerâ€™s account.
- Response: Whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no).
- Campaign Outcome: The result of the marketing campaign (success/failure).

#### Key Objectives
- Data Analysis: To identify patterns between customer characteristics and their responses to marketing campaigns.
- Predictive Modeling: To build machine learning models that predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
- Insights Generation: Understand which factors most strongly influence a customer's decision.

#### Workflow
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values.
                      Encoding categorical variables.
                      Data normalization and scaling.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing customer demographics, financial characteristics, and campaign outcomes.
                                   Visualizations to show correlations between features and subscription outcomes.
  
- Model Building: Various machine learning models were employed, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes.
                  Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
